TODO:
- Replace platorm specific route cell with a xaml ViewCell 
- Test on iOS (especially to fix platorm specific cell) 
- Figure out how to cache translink data ESPECIALLY in favourites pages to reduce loading times 
- Ability to delete a single route/stop from favourites from the favourite list pages
- Save bay numbers in favourites and compare them when checking equality for showing correct favourite/unfavourite button
- Implement distance display 
- Replace const DEFAULT_RADIUS and other defaults with something else like a parameter or a setting that can be changed 
- Figure out how to cache gps data 
- Get rid of StopInfo and just use Stop class
- Make ActivityIndicator properly centered in pages
- Figure out ways to minimize usage of xaml.cs classes e.g. removal of definition of OnAppearing() in RouteListPage.xaml.cs
- Clean up UI 
- Cleaner list (maybe a table) 
- Settings for changing amount of results / maximum amount of time from departure 
- Set up notification system for a certain route/stop 

Design ideas 
- Search bar for custom location/address (hard!!)
- Results are listed by distance from you/address 
- Tap search results to get more information about it 
  - schedule 
  - distance from you
