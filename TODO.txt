TODO:  
- Handling invalid stop/route numbers
- Handling possible errors from the API 
- Drop down menu for routes
- Saved "favourite" stops 
- Better organize classes
- Make XML parsing using an actual XML parser library 
- Search for nearby stops
- Clean up UI 
- Cleaner list (maybe a table) 
- Settings for changing amount of results / maximum amount of time from departure 
- Set up notification system for a certain route/stop 

Design ideas 

- Main page lists for stops nearby you 
- Search bar for custom location/address (hard!!)
- Results are listed by distance from you/address 
- Tap search results to get more information about it 
  - schedule 
  - distance from you 
  - 
- Button on main page (or side menu) for search by stop number
