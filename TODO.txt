TODO:  
- Implement page that appear when a favourite stop is selected
- Refactor DepartureDataService, it is more complex than necessary 
- Figure out how to cache translink data ESPECIALLY in favourites pages to reduce loading times 
- Maybe order departures by time instead of route number 
- Replace const DEFAULT_RADIUS and other defaults with something else like a parameter or a setting that can be changed 
- Figure out how to cache gps data 
- Get rid of StopInfo and just use Stop class
- Make ActivityIndicator properly centered in pages
- Figure out ways to minimize usage of xaml.cs classes e.g. removal of definition of OnAppearing() in RouteListPage.xaml.cs
- Make alert appear for when GPS is not available or disabled
- Drop down menu for routes
- Saved "favourite" stops 
- Better organize classes
- Make XML parsing using an actual XML parser library 
- Search for nearby stops
- Clean up UI 
- Cleaner list (maybe a table) 
- Settings for changing amount of results / maximum amount of time from departure 
- Set up notification system for a certain route/stop 

Design ideas 

- Main page lists for ROUTES nearby you (stops gives unnecessary list entries which are hard to read)
  - Routes number is in big letters for easy readability 
  - Tapping it shows stops nearby on route and departure times 
- Search bar for custom location/address (hard!!)
- Results are listed by distance from you/address 
- Tap search results to get more information about it 
  - schedule 
  - distance from you
