TODO:  
- Get rid of StopInfo and just use Stop class
- Indicate when work is being done with ActivityIndicator (searching for stops etc.)
- Make alert appear for when GPS is not available or disabled
- Handling invalid route numbers
- Handling possible errors from the API 
- Drop down menu for routes
- Saved "favourite" stops 
- Better organize classes
- Make XML parsing using an actual XML parser library 
- Search for nearby stops
- Clean up UI 
- Cleaner list (maybe a table) 
- Settings for changing amount of results / maximum amount of time from departure 
- Set up notification system for a certain route/stop 

Design ideas 

- Main page lists for ROUTES nearby you (stops gives unnecessary list entries which are hard to read)
  - Routes number is in big letters for easy readability 
  - Tapping it shows stops nearby on route and departure times 
- Search bar for custom location/address (hard!!)
- Results are listed by distance from you/address 
- Tap search results to get more information about it 
  - schedule 
  - distance from you
