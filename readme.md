# Vancouver Transit Estimator 

This is a mobile app (currently only tested on Android) written using Xamarin.Forms to help users quickly get time estimates for bus departures from saved stops or routes in the Vancouver Translink transit system. 

I created this app because I wanted a lightweight replacement for using google maps that would get the exact stop/route that I wanted quicker for more experienced transit users. 

## Features 

* Search for stops by stop number 
* Time estimates for busses coming to routes and stops 
* Show nearby routes/stops using geolocation 
* Saved favourite routes/stops
